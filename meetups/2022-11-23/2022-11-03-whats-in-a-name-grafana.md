What's in a name? The moment someone hears Grafana, they immediately think of the all the possible visualisations of data they can do. That is a huge part of what the Open Source project provides, but Grafana is an overloaded term. In this talk, we'll go over:

- Open source projects related to Grafana
- What is Grafana Labs?
