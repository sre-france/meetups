__author bio__:
Co-Founder of Koyeb, a company delivering a next-generation serverless platform, Yann spent the last 10 years building cloud service providers in the infrastructure space from scratch.
Passionated by cloud computing, he has an excellent understanding of the industry and all the underlying infrastructure, from datacenters to the software stack running on hypervisors.
After building Scaleway, which started as a serverfull IaaS provider with BareMetal ARM servers, Yann realized that the future was serverless :)

__abstract__:
**The other side of the story: what it takes to build & operate a Serverless engine**
Using serverless certainly comes with its own set of challenges, but there is another side of the story which is not often told: how serverless platforms are built and what are their technological limitations.
At Koyeb, we’re a cloud service provider building a serverless platform. I will walk you through how we built our own serverless engine, the key decisions we had to make and what our architecture looks like. We now have a purpose-built stack based on Nomad, Firecracker, and Kuma.
We will talk about the underlying technological components of serverless platforms including orchestration, virtualization, and networking.
