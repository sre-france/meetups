__abstract__:
After 4 years and over 20 millions lines of terraform, we have learned a lot at Padok on how to write IAC at scale. The WYSIWYG pattern allowed techs at Padok to align on good practices and improve maintainability. During the talk, I’ll tell you the problem we were facing, why we created WYSIWYG, how we diffused it to the whole team, and of course we’ll finish with the remaining challenges ahead of us.
