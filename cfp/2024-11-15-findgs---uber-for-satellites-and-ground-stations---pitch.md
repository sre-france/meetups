### Abstract

**findGS: An "Uber for Satellites and Ground Stations"**

I am the co-founder of findGS, a platform designed to connect satellite operators with ground station owners through a pay-per-use modelâ€”essentially an "Uber for Satellites and Ground Stations." In this talk, I will introduce the concept of findGS, discuss the challenges and opportunities in optimizing satellite communications, and share insights from my work in the space domain at ESA. While the platform is still in development, I aim to present the idea, gather feedback, and explore potential collaborations. I am also seeking a co-founder to help bring this solution to fruition.

**Comment**

I recognize that this topic may be outside the usual scope of SRE France meetups. However, I believe that the themes of optimization, resource utilization, and innovative technological solutions could resonate with the community. My goal is to share this project, learn from the audience's expertise, and foster discussions that might bridge our fields. I appreciate your consideration and am excited about the possibility of presenting at the event.
