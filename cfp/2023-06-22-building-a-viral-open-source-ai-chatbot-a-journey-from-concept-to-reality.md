### Abstract

This talk is about how we built [Quivr](https://www.quivr.app/) - the open-source virtual brain. In one month we went from 0 to 1,500 active users and gained 8.3k stars on Github. 

While building Quivr, we got to experience and interact with an incredible community excited about open source tech in the generative AI space. We will talk about the challenges we faced both building and scaling a generative AI powered app without it costing the earth. We will cover the unique challenges of keeping the project open source and super easy to both use and contribute to, no matter the skill level, available hardware or cloud experience. 

Come along, it should be fun :)
