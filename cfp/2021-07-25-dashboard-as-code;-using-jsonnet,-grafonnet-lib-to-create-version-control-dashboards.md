__abstract__: Most people copy/paste the Grafana json in a github repo and call that version controlling the dashboard. Although it does version control the dashboard, it does not make the widgets easily reusable and it is hardly ever maintained. In this talk I would go through one way of maintaining grafana dashboard as code using jsonnet, grafonnet-lib, and grizzly, we will also go through all the benefits that comes with it.
