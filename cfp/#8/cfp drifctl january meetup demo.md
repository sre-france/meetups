title: Live demo of driftctl : a free and open-source CLI that tracks, analyses, and warns of infrastructure drift

expected time : 10 mins

abstract: Infrastructure as code is awesome, but there are too many moving parts: codebase, state file, actual cloud state. Things tend to drift.
Drift can have multiple causes: from developers creating or updating infrastructure through the web console without telling anyone, to uncontrolled updates on the cloud provider side. Handling infrastructure drift vs the codebase can be challenging.
We will perform a live demo based on Terraform and AWS of driftctl, a free and open-source CLI that tracks, analyzes, prioritizes, and warns of infrastructure drift.

author bio: CTO and entrepreneur, I am building driftctl (Open Source CLI that measures infrastucture as code coverage, and tracks infrastructure drift) and am currently founder at CloudSkiff, empowering developers to make their infrastructure code better and safely ship infrastructures in short cycles. I am also the author of “Infrastructure-as-Code Cookbook” and have worked essentially remotely for the last 10+ years in Canada and Europe. Fun fact, I love ancient philosophy and also co-launched and run a community radio.
