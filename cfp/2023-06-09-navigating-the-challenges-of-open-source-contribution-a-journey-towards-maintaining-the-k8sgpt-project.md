### Abstract

Contributing to open-source projects is not always an easy task, and becoming a maintainer of a popular open-source project comes with even greater challenges. In this presentation, I will share my personal experiences and the steps I took to become a maintainer of the highly successful [k8sgpt](https://github.com/k8sgpt-ai/k8sgpt) project, which has amassed over 2600 stars. This talk aims to shed light on the difficulties faced during the journey and provide insights into the project itself. Additionally, a brief overview of the K8SGPT tool will be presented to provide context and encourage the community to contribute to its growth. This presentation will serve as an inspiration and guidance for individuals aspiring to become maintainers in the open-source community.
