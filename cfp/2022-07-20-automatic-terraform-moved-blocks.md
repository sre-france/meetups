__abstract__:
When refactoring a Terraform codebase, you often need to write "moved" blocks. This can be tedious. I wrote a tool that does most of the work for you. Refactoring is now painless so we can do it more often and better maintain our codebases. This talk will show the tool in action. Hopefully you will want to try it out!
