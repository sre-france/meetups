__abstract__:

In this talk, we'll cover an overview of [Ignition](https://github.com/coreos/ignition), an open-source software developed by Fedora CoreOS and used by a couple of Linux distribution (mainly cloud oriented like Flatcar).

Illustrated with configuration examples, we will start from the execution in the initramfs to a fully booted and provisioned system. To finally have a look into Ignition config generation and how it's possible to contribute to the software.
