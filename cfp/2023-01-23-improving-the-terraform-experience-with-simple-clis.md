__abstract__:
Terraform is the go-to infrastructure-as-code tool for many organisations, but using it at scale can be painful. Thankfully, you can easily write command-line tools to improve the Terraform experience for your organisation. In this talk, I will share the core libraries you can use to build a tool that integrates well with Terraform, as well as two concrete use-cases: refactoring with [tfautomv](https://github.com/padok-team/tfautomv) and codebase exploration with [tftree](https://github.com/busser/tftree).
