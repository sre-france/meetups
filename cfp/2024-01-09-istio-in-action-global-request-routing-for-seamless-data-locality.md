### Abstract

Data locality has grown in importance due to regulations like GDPR and CCPA, necessitating user data to reside in specific jurisdictions. Addressing these requirements while maintaining a consistent user experience across regions presents a technical challenge.

This session will detail how Pigment utilized Kubernetes and Istio to address these demands. Attendees will discover Pigmentâ€™s approach to achieving data locality through Istio-based request routing, the implementation of custom headers for routing decisions, and the development of an Envoy middleware to manage edge cases.

By highlighting real-world challenges and solutions, this presentation aims to provide insights into managing data locality in a multi-cluster environment using service mesh technologies.
