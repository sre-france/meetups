### Abstract


The pitch of our session:

The more reliable the service, the more it costs to operate. Defining the lowest level of reliability that is expected for users : thatâ€™s what SLOs are about. Product team and Tech team are responsible to discuss conjointly the service(s) to be tracked and their associated objective(s) to be reached. 

During this session, we will present how we built combined SLOs to represent our features and how we gain the adhesion of implied teams. The SLO concept is now shared between the tech and the product team ; it allows to identify range of improvements and help to prioritize backlog items. This presentation will go through the technical challenges we faced,  how we setup the processes and finally how we gain teams adoption.
