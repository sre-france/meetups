### Abstract

Having a single pane of glass for your observability data is key to understand and monitor distributed systems (and for the sanity of your SRE teams).
In this quick talk, we will demonstrate how we leverage observability pipelines and Vector.dev to send our observability data from multiple on-edge kubernetes clusters to GCP Cloud logging.
